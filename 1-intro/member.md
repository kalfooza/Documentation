#### As a group member...

##### 1. notification

Each group member is sent a notification by the _Make it Social_ system.
This could be email or SMS, or both.

##### 2. notification response

The members of the group, respond by clicking the link in the notification. They are redirected to the _Make it Social_ login and registration page, and login.

##### 3. member payment capture

Group members are prompted to make their own payments for the booking, assuming
that they have logged into the _Make it Social_ system.

##### 4. prepay

If the event is a prepay event or has group discounts, then there is a threshold
of group member payment captures, that has to be reached.
Note that the group leader can finalise the group booking at anytime.
However if bookings are below the threshold then the standard payment is
applied, not the discount. The bank reserves the financing for up to 7 days.

##### 5. finalise booking

When ready the group leader finalises the booking, the payment from the bank is
triggered, and the Provider is paid. If there are any discounts and the
group booking thresholds have been met, then the discount is applied.

##### 6. final notification

After the payment has been made the _Make it Social_ system sends a
notification to all the group members confirming the booking and detailing
the receipt of the payment.
