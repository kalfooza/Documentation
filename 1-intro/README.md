# Introduction

In a typical use case there are three principle actors:

1. Provider - the organisation hosting the booking service, e.g. Cinema booking
   company
2. Group Leader - the leader of the group inviting other group members to the
   event
3. Group Member - an indvidual that is a part of a group

### Understanding our Group Booking Tools

As a Provider, you are required to make some changes to your booking site in
order to integrate our group booking functionality.

However we have tried to make it as easy as possible to do this.  
There are two options:

1. Add a "Web Component" to your booking page.
2. Build your own components, and call our API directly.

#### Using Web Components

Web Components are reusable widgets in web documents or web applications.
Our Web Components are white labled and can be easily customised to "fit" your brand and
styling. You simply drop these "components" into your booking page, and they
handle all the API calls to our group booking system for you.

We use Web Components to capture, the contact details of group members, and
make group bookings by interacting with the _Make it Social_ API service.

#### Using our API

Alternatively you may want to call our group booking API directly, and we have a
comprehensive service to allow you to do this.
