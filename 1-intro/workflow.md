# Typical Customer Booking Flow

Group bookings involve group leaders and group members interacting with a system in a number of ways.
To understand how our group booking APIs and components work, it helps to know the
typical customer booking process.

#### As a group leader

##### 1. invite
At the point of registering and booking, the group leader engages with the
_Make it Social_
Web Component form and enters the contact details of all the group members.
These details include things like, email addresses and phone numbers.
Optionally the group leader can add a personal message which group members
receive when the booking notification is sent.

##### 2. register

If the group leader hasn't logged in or registered with the _Make it Social_
platform, they are prompted to do so.

##### 3. select seats (if a seating event)

If the booking event has seating then the leader is presented with a seat map, and
is required to select the appropriate seats, for the group.

##### 4. leader payment capture

The group leader is prompted to pay for their own booking, they do not need
to pay for any other members of the group. Additionally if the Provider needs
any further information about the leader they can request it at this stage.
