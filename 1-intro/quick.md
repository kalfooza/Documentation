# Quick Set Up

To use the _Make it Social_ API and Web Components, you need to
register for an `APPID` and `KEY`.

Registration is made on our client page: <https://client.makeitsocial.com/>

### Generate keys
To authenticate against our API, and carry out requests there are 3 principle
values you will need:

1. An `APPID`, usually your email address
2. A security `KEY`
3. A `PAYID` or `SID`, your payment key

All these values can be obtained from the _Make it Social_ client web page,
mentioned above.
