# Product

A Product is an item, service or event that the Provider is selling. For
example this could be, a football match, a film, a meal at a restaurant. A
Product is something that has a social nature.

To create a Product using the _Make it Social_ API, you will need send a JSON
document to our "create Products" API endpoint, with your authentication
credentials. Please ensure that you have already set these up, see the [quick set
up](/1-intro/README.md) page.
